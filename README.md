# video_Download

This Python script allows you to download YouTube videos using the `yt-dlp` library in the best available quality. The downloaded video will be saved with the video title as the filename.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
- **yt-dlp**: The script uses the `yt-dlp` library to handle YouTube video downloading.

## Installation

1. **Install Python**: If you don't have Python installed, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install yt-dlp**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install yt-dlp

## How to use

just replace the url in the code with whatever you video you want. if you select a video from a playlist, it will attempt to download the whole playlist and I dont know how to fix that so just a warning.
